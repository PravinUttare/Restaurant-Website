                                Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the
                                Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and
                                occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs,
                                vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in
                                particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions. Centuries of Islamic rule,
                                particularly by the Mughals, also introduced dishes like samosa and pilaf. Historical
                                events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
                                introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World
                                brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as the
                                potato, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and Guava have become staples in many regions of
                                India. Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade
                                between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices
                                were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced
                                other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (especially Britain), the
                                Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius,
                                Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.
